# Inventory Accuracy Data Science Project


##Schedule

| Phase | Details | Due Date |
| ----- | ------- | -------- |
| Project planning | Please prepare your project description using the following format
- 200 words abstract
- data source and description
- pipeline of steps (in a block diagram)
- Metrics for success

Develop a road of tasks. 
Assign a time line and people to each task.
Create a project page and populate with details and diagrams and share with Jimi. GitHub should be fine. | Sept 5, 2016 |


Get sample data and build baseline
Get at least 10,000 samples of data and build a baseline model. (look at the HHP Spark notebook for guidance)
Sept 19, 2016


Do EDA of data and derive new features
Perform EDA of a larger dataset (tens/hundreds of thousands of examples). Propose new features and implement 5 new features. Experiment and report scores on new models compared to baseline.
Oct 3, 2016
Feature engineering and modeling  
Implement 5 more  features. d Experiment with  3 different machine learning algorithms using different hyperparameters settings. Graph results and report recommendations. Optional: are your results statistically significant?
October 10, 2016
Final review
Meet in person with all project teams. Final internal presentation by each team. Happy Hour following project presentation!

NOTES
For all projects, given the short timeline, please focus on the machine learning aspects of your project (no need to rewrite data pipelines yet). As much as possible try to leverage existing data and pipelines.  If this is not possible please let Jimi know immediately. 

Please use your projectID in the subject line  of all communication relating to your project. Please review the project schedule below and let me know your thoughts. Where possible, please share with your managers and get their buy in for time to work these projects.
