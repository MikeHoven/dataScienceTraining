Metrics for Success: Inventory Accuracy Percentage

There is a great opportunity to improve inventory accuracy.  Inventory accuracy problems may arise at 3 main stages; the Vendor, within the Distribution Centers and within Stores.  Issues with the Vendor stem from the Item Setup / Maintenance in the system or sending the wrong amount of items.  Distribution Center problems are due to Trailer Accuracy often a result of poor quality control when breaking down Vendor receipts for different locations.  Stores also contribute to inaccurate inventory due to items lost or misplaced in the backroom or even the sales floor and when customers move an item from it’s original shelf.  Data for this project comes from several sources.  For our purposed we will focus our efforts with our owned data stored in Teradata and HDFS Hive Databases.  Achieving the goal using a predictive model to highlight where to concentrate our efforts will provide multiple benefits.  There will be less out of stocks as inventory can accurately be replenished with better data.  Need more accurate inventory to shift to a different accounting strategy.
